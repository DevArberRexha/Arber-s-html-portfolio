<h1>The Best Movies According to Arber</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie since I was a kid I growed up with this movie. 
The freedom and resiliance of the spirit are some of the most important qualities and they are 
delivered very powerfully in the message of the movie.</p>

<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>A timeless classic with its compelling story, authentic characters, and witty dialogue.
    (I always liked movies about geniuses)

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Super beautiful animation, I just love animated movies like "Silent Voice" and "I want to eat your pancreas" and others too.</p>
